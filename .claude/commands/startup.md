Read the following files to get up to speed with the project:

1. Search persistent memory for prior context:
   - `memory_search` with `scope=shared` — collective wisdom from all projects
   - `memory_search` with `scope=project` — project-specific WIP and decisions

2. Read `claude/CODEBASE_STATE.md` — current technical state, recent work, and next planned tasks
3. Read `claude/CONTEXT_MEMORY.md` — working context, decisions, and ongoing priorities
4. Read `claude/DEPLOYMENT_STANDARDS.md` — deployment and operations workflow
5. Read any files in `claude/specs/` if they exist
6. List all files in `claude/session_progress/` and read the most recent 2-3 files

After reading these files:
- Summarize the current development status
- Identify pending tasks from "Next Planned Work"
- Note any blockers or technical debt
- Ask what we're working on today
